							<h3 class="question">"Are there any requirements to take this course?"</h3>
							<p class="answer">The requirements are:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>You must be fluent in English</li>
								<li>
									You must be able to recite the Qur'an with Ease. (Tajweed is highly recommended)

						</li>
						<li>
							<h3 class="question">"What are the timings for the classes?"</h3>
							<p class="answer">
								Natadarrab&trade; is a concept-based course. Meaning, it's extremely flexible if you
								get the work done. My job is to make sure that all the concepts are installed in
								your head by any means necessary. This is done through interactive quizzes,
								tutorials, videos, etc.
							</p>
							<p class="answer">
								However, I realize that sometimes a live connection between the student and the
								teacher are extremely necessary. <br />For this, I have a ticketing system by which
								you can ask questions, and I will personally answer.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3 class="question">"What if I fail?"</h3>
							<p class="answer">
								Failure is an important part of learning. Infact, failure sometimes teaches more
								than success itself. As your coach, my job will be to make sure that you fail <i
									>responsibly</i
								>. Failing itself is an art, and I make sure you master it.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3 class="question">"How long do I have access to the course?"</h3>
							<p class="answer">
								You have access to the Natadarrab&trade; platform for as long as your subscription
								is active.

							<h3 class="question">"Will I get free updates?"</h3>
							<p class="answer">
								Yes! The Natadarrab library will continue to grow forever, inshaAllah! And you will
								have access to all it's research functionalities throughout your subscription.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li>
							<h3 class="question">"Why do you charge money for teaching Religion?!"</h3>
							<p class="answer">
								Believe it or not, I'm a human being. And faith in God's guidance teaches us that
								human beings should exert energy to survive and thrive. Thriving results in better
								work in the world. The cost helps content-creation and is a compensation for the
								time I give.
							</p>
						</li>
						<!-- <li>
							<h3 class="question">"I can't afford it:"</h3>
							<p class="answer">
								Apply anyway! If you can prove how serious you are about learning, then I can help
								you with the financial side of things.

			<br />
			<p class="answer">
				Lol wut? This isn't about me. To access the Qur'an you just need to know the things
				mentioned <a href="#curriculum" style="background: #a30909; padding: 2px;" class="clean-a"
					>in the curriculum above</a
				>. I just facilitate those things for you. <br /><br />I belong to no organization or group.
				I answer only to Allah. This allows me to change my mind easily once you prove your point
				starting from the Qur'an. Boom bamï»¿ bop botta bot bomp pow!
